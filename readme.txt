== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is the service free? =
There is a trial period free, then for high traffic sites there is an annual fee. The restriction is based on the number of exposures of the "Operator Available" button.
We estimated that the restricion allows the majority of personal websites to continue to use the free version.
